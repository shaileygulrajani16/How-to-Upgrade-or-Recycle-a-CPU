      <div style="text-align: left">
      <p>
     Make sure the third party site that sells the computer parts are reliable. Some sites will scam the user and send fake or third party parts.

If the comments mentions many negative infomation then avoid buying.  Also if the price of the cpu you want to buy seems too good to be true then it would be best to avoid it. Reddit or other forums will show people talking about where to shop and will include good suggestions with purchases.
